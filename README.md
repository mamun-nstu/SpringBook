SpringBook is a social media website like facebook. We can write post here or upload images.
All post and images are then sorted by post time which is also visible in post list.
The data is stored in browser's local storage, fetched from there and appeared in DOM.
It's my assignment project while working as an intern in Spring Rain Private LTD.
